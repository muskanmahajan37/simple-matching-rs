# Simple matching program

Matching exercise in Rust:

>Given a tuple containing an int and a bool, use a match statement to determine (a) if the bool is true and the int is between 20 and 26, (b) if the bool is true and the aforementioned condition isn't true for the int, (c) if the int is between 40 and 49 (where the value of the bool doesn't matter), and (d), wherein none of the previous conditions are true. Print out an appropriate message using println for each case.
